## User Stories
- As a user, I can see a list of all the places I've visted
- As a user, I can click on one of my places and have it take me a page with more information
- As a user, I can create a new place and see that it immediately loads on the page so that I know I successfully added a place
- As a user, I can delete a place so I can keep my travel log relevant
- As a user, I can update a place in case I need to add information or there were errors
